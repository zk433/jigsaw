I am a full stack web developer with a university degree in Psychology, currently working as **Laravel developer**. 

My education and past work experience have led me to become **an accessibility advocate**. I firmly believe that all web products should be accessible and available to everyone \- regardless of their abilities or conditions. 

In Autumn 2017 I was awarded the Google/Udacity **Mobile Web Specialist nanodegree** scholarship, which I successfully completed in July 2018. 

I have also recently given two **presentations** to my local WordPress community: Accessibility in Wordpresss and How to create child themes in Wordpress.

In June 2018 I was **published in the [Net magazine](https://creativebloq.com)** (August issue) describing my journey from being a psychology graduate to becoming an accessibility advocate.

Few technical details for those interested in my design and development workflow:  

  
>I use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) for designing user interfaces and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice. I like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), the PHP framework for Web Artisans, and use [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/blade) as a templating engine. I use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a task runner and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor. I like to code using vanilla JavaScript (ES5, ES6), but I work well with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) as well. I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories to store my code. When I develop WordPress websites, I use [Local by Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/) as my local development environment. This website is built with [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/), the Static Site Generator for Laravel developers, and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) \- an all\-in\-one platform that makes hosting static websites as well as other modern web projects incredibly easy.
